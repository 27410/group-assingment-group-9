    "- [X] DONE\n",
    "- [ ] Calculate theoretical maximum yields for chosen product for suitable carbon sources\n",
    "- [ ] Plot phenotypic phase planes for relevant process conditions (anaerobic vs aerobic for example, what makes more sense?)\n",
    "- [ ] Computationally enumerate all potential production pathways to your chosen product (even if it is a native product) and score them by different metrics (yield, number of steps added,)\n",
    "- [ ] Compute gene knockout strategies using algorithms like OptKnock, OptGene and OptCouple\n",
    "- [ ] Compute over-expression and down-regulation targets\n",
    "- [ ] Compute co-factor swap targets\n",
    "- [ ] Assess your predicted strain designs using simulations and pathway visualizations\n",
    "- [ ] Assess manually derived strain designs using model simulations\n",
    "- [ ] Simulate batch cultivations using dynamic FBA\n",
    "- [ ] Based on your computations, provide a top 10 list of most promising cell factory designs. The criteria for \"most promising\" are the number of modifications, yield, growth rate and others you might define\n",
