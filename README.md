# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 9 - Application of Genome Scale Modeling for L-lysine production through _Corynebacterium glutamicum_

## Project summary (<300 words)

L-lysine is an essential amino acid used as an ingredient in both the food industry to ensure nutrially levels, and the cosmetics industry. For instance, annual global production of L-lysine is around one million tons and is expected to rise. The current state-of-the-art on its production is a Fermentation Based Biomanufacturing based on the bacterium _Corynebacterium glutamicum_ and glucose as a feedstock.   

The aim of the project has been to understand and characterize how GEMs approachs can contribuite and guide the scientistic community for improving L-lysine biomanufacturing. Two GSM models for _C. glutamicum_ have been assessed here: iCGB21R (2021) and iCW773 (2017). Then, some analysis were performed regarding the effects of swtching the carbon soruce in the media. Furthermore, the ratinal engineering done in a influential paper in metabolic engineering was tried to be reproduced in iCGB21R. Finally, it is also explored, throught manual gene knokout and the cameo package further ways to improve L-lysine production. Moreover, it is also implemented a pipeline to facilitate working with the model, annotating the genes with their common name instead of the, cryprtic code used in the original iCGB21FR. 

Overall, it has been proven that using GEM could become a powerful tool to further investigate and simulate improvement in the L-lysine production and its cell factory, representing a shortcut on the laboratory experiments.
