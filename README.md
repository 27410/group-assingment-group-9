# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 9 - Application of Genome Scale Modeling for L-lysine production through _Corynebacterium glutamicum_

## Project summary (<300 words)

The aim of our work has been to understand and characterize how GEMs can contribuite and guide the scientist in the wet lab for improving L-lysine productivity.
We started by taking into consideration two model: iCGB21R and ICFRWe performed analysis regarding the effects of different media and we reproduce the ratinal engineering done in a influential paper.
We also explored, throught manual gene knokout and the cameo package further ways to improve L-lysine production.
In our project we also implemented a pipeline for making easier to work with the model, annotating the genes with their common name instead of the, cryprtic code used in iCGB21FR
